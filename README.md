# Neovim from scratch

For the original config, please see https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch. This repository is adapated from it. 

## Setup 


### Local Computer

If on a local computer (my slow computer:), use the `main` branch after cloning.

### Server

If on a server, use the `server` branch.

_Note that the main setting difference between local computers vs. server is that server 1. enables `OSC 52` for copying to system clipboard, and 2. it enables gitlines_.
